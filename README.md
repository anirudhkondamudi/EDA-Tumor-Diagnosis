Tumor Diagnosis using Exploratory Data Analysis via SeaBorn

Follow These Steps:-

Step1:-Load Libs and Data.

Step2:-For a clear view in Data separate Target from features.

Step3:-Plot Diagnosis Distributions (Countplot).

Step4:-Visualize Standardized Data(Violinplot,Boxplot).

Step5:-For feature Comparison use JointPlots.

Step6:-Use Swarm Plots for observe Distribution of (Values,Variance).

Step7:-Plot a HeatMap to observe Pair-wise Correlations.



About the Dataset:

The Breast Cancer Diagnostic data is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].


Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
